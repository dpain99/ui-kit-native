A beautiful, flexible UI package, production-ready component based on react-native components.

The goal of `ui-kit-native` is expanding the original `React Native component` by adding animations, style customization options, and new features, while still providing a simple API.

-------------------------img here-----------------------



## Features
â€¢	Plain simple and flexibel API

â€¢	Easy to edit

â€¢	Friendly for React Native apps

â€¢	Replace and extend basic react native components


## Setup
This library is available on npm, install it:
```
npm i ui-kit-native

```
We use the following dependencies:

    "react": ">=18.x.x",
    "react-native": ">=0.71.x",
    "react-native-modal": ">=13.x.x",
    "react-native-svg": ">=13.11.x",
    "react-native-vector-icons": ">=10.x.x"

## Usage

We have all the basic components that make up the user interface like: input, button, view, layout...

Since `ui-kit-native` is an extension of the original React Native component, it works in a similar fashion.

1. Import `ui-kit-native`:

   ```JS
       import {Button, FormInput, LayoutContainer} from 'ui-kit-native';

   ```
